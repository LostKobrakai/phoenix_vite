# PhoenixVite

The library â€¦

- provides an igniter.installer to install all the necessary files
  - creates elixir and js boilerplate
  - configures phoenix LV static file tracking with the manifest vite generates
  - uses phoenix static_url configuration to handle all static assets via the vite dev server
  - moves static assets from priv/static to assets/public
- provides a heex function component to pull in js/css from
  - vite dev server in development
  - the vite manifest in prod
- can optionally pull in :bun to run without a locally installed nodejs, just like phoenix does by default
